Mocha Large Test Finder
==================

Wanting to refactor some tests to be smaller or simpler? But don't know where to start?
If so, this package might be for you!
This is a simple package to find large tests in a code repo.
It searches for .test.js or .spec.js files, and looks at the number of lines in the it() blocks
It then outputs the tests with the most lines.
